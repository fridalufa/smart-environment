#### Sample Makefile for building applications with the RIOT OS

#### The example file system layout is:
#### ./application Makefile
#### ../../RIOT

# Set the name of your application:
APPLICATION = smart-environment

# If no BOARD is found in the environment, use this default:
BOARD ?= native

# This has to be the absolute path to the RIOT base directory:
RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../RIOT
